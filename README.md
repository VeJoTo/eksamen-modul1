# Daisy Ui and Tailwind CSS - why I chose to use a library over a custom CSS

When we were told we could use almost anything to code, I wanted to explore how to use libraries. I read about different libraries/frameworks which would be possible to implement a design system in. Bootstrap, Material UI, and TailwindCSS showed up as promising candidates. I choose Tailwind CSS because there was much excitement over the time you could save by not switching back and forth between CSS and HTML all the time. Writing CSS yourself can often add unintended changes to other parts of HTML pages.

It took quite some time to learn and getting used to the names of the classes and how the library is set up, but I think the choice was right although I was frustrated at first. I also used a library which is based upon TailwindCSS, namely DaisyUI. DaisyUI is much more like a customizable design system where you can override existing themes and apply your own colors, fonts and round edges.
